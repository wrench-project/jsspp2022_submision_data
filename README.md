# jsspp2022_submission_data

This repository contains data, scripts, and code for making the research in a JSSPP'22 submission reproducible.

## Simulator code

The simulator is hosted in [another repository](https://github.com/wrench-project/scheduling_using_simulation_simulator). All experiments are
conducted with the simulator with commit tag `b58de28b66d80df91d1a57855acf967f2c4b7c81`. 
A Dockerfile for a Docker image in which the simulator is installed in
`/usr/local/bin/scheduling_using_simulation_simulator` is 
available in `simulator/Dockerfile`. Cloning this repository into a
container for that image is likely the easiest way to run all scripts
mentioned hereafter. Here are the steps for building the image, starting a
container, logging into it, and cloning this repository:

```
cd simulator/
docker build -t reproducible_research .
docker run -it --rm reproducible_research /bin/bash
git clone https://github.com/wrench-project/jsspp2022_submision_data.git
```

## Workflow JSON files

All JSON workflow description files, which are [WfCommons instances](https://wfcommons.org/instances), are available in the `workflows/` directory. 

## Script to run all simulations

A script to run all simulations is available in `run_script/run_all_simulations.py`. It requires that a Mongo daemon run locally, so that simulation output can be stored in a database.  This script takes as input a number of threads to use and a list of compute platform configurations to simulate. For instance, to run this script in the Docker container, first start a Mongo daemon:

```
mkdir /tmp/db
mongod --dbpath=/tmp/db 
```

and (in another terminal connected to the container):

```
cd jsspp2022_submission_data/run_scripts
./run_all_simulations.py 4 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
```

Note that the above will run for a VERY long time (we ran it on VMs on the
cloud, one per platform configuration, with 48 threads on each). We highly
recommend you use the provided database dump below. 

## Simulation raw output

Simulation raw output is available as a Mongo database dump in `mongo_db_dump/simulation-result-dump.zip`. This is the output that was generated by the `run_script/run_all_simulations.py` script for all 9 platform configurations presented in the paper. 
Here are the steps to inject the database dump into the (locally running) Mongo daemon:

```
cd jsspp2022_submission_data/mongo_db_dump/
unzip simulation-result-dump.zip
mongorestore simulation-result-dump
```

## Scripts to extract simulation output from Mongo

A script to extract and summarize simulation output data from the Mongo database is available in `extract_script/extract_all_results.py`. This script generates several `*.dict` files, which are also included in the `extract_script/` directory.  If you want to run the script to (re-) generate these `*.dict` files, make sure that a Mongo daemon runs locally that has been fed the database dump in directory `mongo_db_dump/` directory. 


## Scripts to plot/analyze the simulation output

Scripts to plot/analyze extracted simulation output data are available in the `plot_scripts` directory.  These scripts take as input the `*.dict` files available in the `extract_scripts/` directory. The generate `.pdf` images and text output, which is used in the paper to discuss simulation results.
